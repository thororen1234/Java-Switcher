# Setup
For .bash_profile:

Please check the .bash_profile file.

Example: `jdk 6` will switch to version 1.6.

After entering the code above into your .bash_profile run source .bash_profile.

For .zshrc:

Please check the .zshrc file.

Example: `jdk 6` will switch to version 1.6.

After entering the code above into your .zshrc run source .zshrc.

# Files
Both files are the same but are seperate if you just want to drag and drop.

Make sure .bash_profile or .zshrc is empty before copying and pasting the file/files.

If they aren't empty copy and paste the inside of the files into your existing .bash_profile or .zshrc.

Unzip the `Mac.zip` file and copy the coponents to your `~` directory (this would be your profile/username)

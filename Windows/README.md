# Important
Most of the java versions are set to their default paths, some versions such as jdk 1.2 through 1.5 are set to a different directory as they would have installed directly to the C drive path.

Make sure to check if they all work and if some don't check your java paths in `C:\Program Files\Java\` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\` so you can compare them to javaX.bat.

# Setup
Type env into your search bar and click the one that says `edit the system environment variables`.

Click on `Environment Variables`.

Go to `System Variables` and scroll until you see Path.

Delete the following entries:
```
C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Oracle\Java\javapath
```

Add the following entries:
```
%JAVA_HOME%\bin
```

Click `OK`.

# JAVA_HOME Variable
Check to see if you have a JAVA_HOME system variable, if you don't follow the steps below:

Click `New...` under `System variables`.

Name the variable `JAVA_HOME` and set its value as one of your java installations from `C:\Program Files\Java\` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\`.

Example:
```
Variable name: JAVA_HOME
Variable value: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-1.8
```
